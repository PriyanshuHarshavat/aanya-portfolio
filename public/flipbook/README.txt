Annie & Froggy Flipbook (Self-Hosted)

What you have:
- index.html  (the flipbook)
- assets/     (page images)

How to use on your website:
1) Upload the whole folder contents to your website hosting (e.g., /flipbook/)
2) Visit: https://YOURDOMAIN.com/flipbook/index.html

Embed in any page:
<iframe src="/flipbook/index.html" style="width:100%; height:800px; border:0; border-radius:12px;"></iframe>

Notes:
- The flip animation uses a CDN script: https://unpkg.com/page-flip/ ...
  If you want it fully offline/no-CDN, tell me what host you use and I’ll package the JS locally.
